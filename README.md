# Test Games

This repository contains a simple side-scrolling platform shooter inspired by **Contra**. It is built with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```

Use the **arrow keys** to move, **Z or Up** to jump, and **Space** to shoot. Enemies spawn from the right; shooting them increases your score. Colliding with an enemy ends the game.
